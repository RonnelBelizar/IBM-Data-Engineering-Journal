# IBM Data Engineering Journey — Python, SQL, and ETL Journal

📘 **About this Repository**  
This is my dedicated learning journal for the **IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate**. It documents my progress, notes, hands-on exercises, and projects as I build core **data engineering skills**.  

💡 The goal of this repository is two-fold:  
1. To serve as my personal notebook, where I break down concepts in my own words.  
2. To showcase my practical skills in **Python, SQL, Databases, and ETL Pipelines** through exercises and projects.

## 🛠️ Skills Covered  
Throughout this journey, I will gain hands-on experience with:  
- **Python for Data Engineering** → scripting, data structures, functions, file handling  
- **SQL & Relational Databases** → queries, joins, normalization, data modeling  
- **ETL Pipelines** → extract, transform, and load workflows  
- **Data Warehousing & Big Data Concepts**
