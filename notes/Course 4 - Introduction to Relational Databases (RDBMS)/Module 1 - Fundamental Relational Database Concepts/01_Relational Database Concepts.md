# üìò Information and Data Models

Information and data models are frameworks that define how data is represented, managed, and related within a system.

---

## Data Management
The process of collecting, storing, organizing, and maintaining data efficiently and securely throughout its lifecycle.

---

## Information Model
An information model defines the meaning, context, and relationships of data. It focuses on how information is understood conceptually rather than how it is stored.

Aspects:
- Represents real-world entities and their relationships  
- Focuses on meaning and semantics  
- Used for business and analytical understanding  

---

## Data Model
A data model defines how data is structured, stored, and accessed within a database. It provides the blueprint for database design and implementation.

Aspects:
- Focuses on data representation and storage  
- Used for database implementation and design  

Schema:
Defines how data is logically organized in the database.  

Tables:
Hold data in rows and columns.  

Columns:
Represent attributes or fields within a table.  

Data Types:
Define the kind of data a column can store (e.g., INTEGER, TEXT, DATE).  

Indexes:
Improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

## Differences Between Information and Data Models

Level of Detail:  
- Information model is high-level and conceptual.  
- Data model is detailed and technical.  

Purpose:  
- Information model defines meaning and context.  
- Data model defines structure and storage.  

Usage:  
- Information model is used by analysts and stakeholders.  
- Data model is used by developers and database administrators.  

System Development:  
- Information model guides early design.  
- Data model implements the database structure.

---

## Hierarchical Model
A data model where data is organized into a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, representing one-to-many relationships.

---

## Types of Data Models
Relational Model: Stores data in tables connected by keys.  
Entity-Relationship Model: Uses entities, attributes, and relationships to represent data.

---

## Converting ER Diagram into Tables
1. Each entity becomes a table.  
2. Each attribute becomes a column.  
3. Primary keys uniquely identify records.  
4. Foreign keys define relationships between tables.

---

## Simplified ER Diagram
STUDENT (Student_ID, Name, Age)  
COURSE (Course_ID, Title)  
ENROLLMENT (Student_ID, Course_ID)

Relationships:  
A student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students.

---

## Concepts in Database Management
Logical Data Independence: Ability to modify the logical schema without affecting applications.  
Physical Data Independence: Ability to change how data is stored physically without altering the logical schema.  
Physical Storage Independence: The separation of physical storage methods from logical data structures.

# üß© ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS (ERDs) AND TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS

An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a visual representation of how data entities relate within a system. It helps organize data logically and serves as a blueprint for database design.

üß† ERD DEFINITION  
An ERD shows entities (tables), their attributes (fields), and how they connect through relationships. It clarifies how information flows through a database and identifies dependencies.

‚öôÔ∏è FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS  
üü¶ ENTITIES ‚Äî Represent objects or concepts that data is stored about. Each entity becomes a database table, and its attributes become columns.  
Example:  
+-------------+  
|   PATIENT   |  
+-------------+  
| Patient_ID  |  
| Name        |  
| Age         |  
| Address     |  
+-------------+  

üü© RELATIONSHIP SETS ‚Äî Define how entities interact with each other. These show the logical associations between data in different tables.  
Example:  
+-----------+           +-----------+  
|  DOCTOR   |           |  PATIENT  |  
+-----------+           +-----------+  
| Doctor_ID |<--------->| Patient_ID|  
| Name      |  treats   | Name      |  
+-----------+           +-----------+  

ü™∂ CROW‚ÄôS FOOT NOTATIONS ‚Äî Used to represent **cardinality**, or how many instances of one entity relate to another.  
O---| ‚Üí Zero or One  
|---| ‚Üí Exactly One  
|---< ‚Üí One to Many  
O---< ‚Üí Zero to Many  
Examples:  
A patient may or may not have insurance ‚Üí O---|  
Each invoice must belong to one customer ‚Üí |---|  
A doctor can treat many patients ‚Üí |---<  
A student may enroll in many courses ‚Üí O---<  

üîÑ TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS  

1Ô∏è‚É£ ONE-TO-ONE (1:1)  
Each record in one entity corresponds to exactly one record in another. Common for optional or sensitive data stored separately.  
Example: A patient has one medical record.  
+-------------+      ||‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ||      +-----------------+  
|   PATIENT   |--------------------|  MEDICAL_RECORD |  
+-------------+                   +-----------------+  
| Patient_ID  |                   | Record_ID       |  
| Name        |                   | Patient_ID (FK) |  
+-------------+                   +-----------------+  

2Ô∏è‚É£ ONE-TO-MANY (1:N)  
One record in an entity can be related to multiple records in another. This is the most common type of relationship.  
Example: A doctor can treat many patients, but each patient has only one doctor.  
+-----------+        ||‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ<        +-----------+  
|  DOCTOR   |----------------------|  PATIENT  |  
+-----------+                     +-----------+  
| Doctor_ID |                     | Patient_ID|  
| Name      |                     | Doctor_ID (FK)|  
+-----------+                     +-----------+  

3Ô∏è‚É£ MANY-TO-MANY (M:N)  
Records in both entities relate to multiple records in the other. This requires a **junction table** to connect them.  
Example: A student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students.  
+-----------+        <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ||‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ>        +-----------+  
|  STUDENT  |--------------------------|  COURSE   |  
+-----------+                         +-----------+  
| Student_ID|                         | Course_ID |  
| Name      |                         | Title     |  
+-----------+                         +-----------+  
          \                             /  
           \                           /  
            \                         /  
             \                       /  
              \                     /  
               \                   /  
                \                 /  
                 \               /  
                  \             /  
                   \           /  
                    \         /  
                     \       /  
                      \     /  
                       \   /  
                        \ /  
                 +----------------+  
                 |   ENROLLMENT   |  
                 +----------------+  
                 | Student_ID (FK)|  
                 | Course_ID  (FK)|  
                 +----------------+

‚ú® In summary, ERDs are blueprints for databases ‚Äî they simplify complex data relationships, improve organization, and ensure data integrity.
