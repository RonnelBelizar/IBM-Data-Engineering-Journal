## üîë Why Read Files in Python?

    ‚Ä¢ Programs often need to work with data stored in files (e.g., .txt, .csv).  
    ‚Ä¢ Python provides simple built-in functions to open, read, and manage files.  
    ‚Ä¢ Common tasks: open a file, check its mode, read contents, then close it.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The `open()` Function

    ‚Ä¢ Syntax: open(filename, mode)  
    ‚Ä¢ filename ‚Üí name of the file you want to access.  
    ‚Ä¢ mode ‚Üí specifies how you want to open the file (read, write, append, etc.).  

    Example:
        file = open("example.txt", "r")

        ‚Ä¢ "example.txt" ‚Üí file name.  
        ‚Ä¢ "r" ‚Üí mode (read mode).  
        ‚Ä¢ file ‚Üí variable that now represents the opened file.  

---

## üìù File Name Attribute (`name`)

    ‚Ä¢ You can check which file has been opened with .name.  

    Example:
        file = open("example.txt", "r")
        print(file.name)

        Output:
        example.txt

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è File Mode Attribute (`mode`)

    ‚Ä¢ You can check the mode in which the file was opened using .mode.  

    Example:
        file = open("example.txt", "r")
        print(file.mode)

        Output:
        r

## 1. Common Modes
    ‚Ä¢ "r" ‚Üí Read (default).  
        - Opens file for reading only.  
        - ‚ùå Error if file doesn‚Äôt exist.  
        - Cursor starts at beginning.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
                print(f.read())

    ‚Ä¢ "w" ‚Üí Write.  
        - Opens file for writing.  
        - ‚ö†Ô∏è Overwrites file if it exists.  
        - Creates new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("This replaces all content!")

    ‚Ä¢ "a" ‚Üí Append.  
        - Opens file for writing at the end.  
        - Does NOT erase existing content.  
        - Creates new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "a") as f:
                f.write("\nThis gets added to the end.")

    ‚Ä¢ "rb" ‚Üí Read in Binary Mode.  
        - Reads file in binary (not text).  
        - Use for images, videos, PDFs.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("image.jpg", "rb") as f:
                data = f.read()

    ‚Ä¢ "wb" ‚Üí Write in Binary Mode.  
        - Writes in binary.  
        - Use when saving images, videos, etc.  
        ‚úÖ Example:
        
            with open("copy.jpg", "wb") as f:
                f.write(data)

---

## 2. Combined Modes

    ‚Ä¢ "w+" ‚Üí Write + Read.  
        - File is truncated (emptied) first.  
        - Creates new file if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "w+") as f:
                f.write("Hello!")
                f.seek(0)   # rewind cursor
                print(f.read())  # prints "Hello!"

    ‚Ä¢ "r+" ‚Üí Read + Write.  
        - Does NOT truncate file.  
        - File must already exist.  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "r+") as f:
                content = f.read()
                f.seek(0)
                f.write("New ")
                f.write(content)

    ‚Ä¢ "a+" ‚Üí Append + Read.  
        - Opens file for reading & appending.  
        - Cursor starts at END of file (need seek(0) to read from start).  
        ‚úÖ Example:

            with open("file.txt", "a+") as f:
                f.write("\nAdded line")
                f.seek(0)  # go back to start
                print(f.read())

---

## ‚ùå Closing Files (`close()`)

    ‚Ä¢ Always close a file when done to free up resources.  
    ‚Ä¢ If not closed, it may lead to memory issues or data corruption.  

    Example:
        file = open("example.txt", "r")
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
        file.close()

---

## ‚úÖ Using `with` (Best Practice)

    ‚Ä¢ The `with` statement ensures the file is closed automatically.  
    ‚Ä¢ Even if an error occurs, Python will safely close the file.  

    Example:
        with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
            print(content)

        ‚Ä¢ No need to call close() ‚Üí handled automatically.  

---

## üß© Reading Files Line by Line

    ‚Ä¢ Useful for large files when you don‚Äôt want to read everything at once.  

    Example:
        with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                print(line.strip())

        ‚Ä¢ for line in file ‚Üí loops through each line.  
        ‚Ä¢ line.strip() ‚Üí removes extra spaces or newline characters (\n).  

---

## ‚ú® Key Points

    ‚Ä¢ Use open("filename", "mode") to open files.  
    ‚Ä¢ Always close files with close(), or better, use with.  
    ‚Ä¢ .name ‚Üí returns the filename.  
    ‚Ä¢ .mode ‚Üí returns the file mode.  
    ‚Ä¢ Common modes: "r", "w", "a", "rb", "wb".  
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Best practice: use with open(...) for safe file handling.
