### Day 15 - (9/18/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Objects and Classes
    
- 💻 What I practiced:
  - How to utilize objects and classes
    
- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This is another form of data organizing and manipulation because it creates a structure with common codes that will be executed
          - Class is like the "blueprint" that contains attributes and what it can do
          - Object is the actual thing created from the blueprint
  
- ❓ Open questions:
  -  How important is this when there are already simpler ways to do what it can do?

### Day 10 - (9/13/25)

  - I enrolled on IBM's 2nd course - Python for Data Science, AI & Development
      -  Focused on RegEx because it was confusing.

- 📘 What I studied today:

  -  Basic Python Types
  -  Basics of Jupyter
  -  Expressions and Variables
  -  String Operations
  -  Python RegEx (Regular Expressions)
  
- 💻 What I practiced:

  -  Focused on RegEx since this was new to me.
    
- 💡 Key takeaway:

  - raw_string = r"C:\new_folder\file.txt"
    print("Raw String:", raw_string)

      - This is a new info for me. putting an "r" before the actual string nullifies the "\n".
        
- ❓ Open questions:
