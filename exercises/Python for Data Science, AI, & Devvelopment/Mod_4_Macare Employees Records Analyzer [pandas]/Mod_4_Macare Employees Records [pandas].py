# ðŸ‘” Exercise: Employee Records Analyzer
# ============================================================
# âœ… Focus: Pandas
# ðŸ“‚ File: employees.txt
#
# Name,Age,Position,Expertise
# Ronnel,29,Engineer,Gx
# Doc,30,Engineer,Gx
# Shed,36,Engineer,Gx
# Bren,29,Engineer,Gx
# Jesh,23,Intern,None
# Rhea,25,Admin,Minutes Of Meeting
# Lara,32,It,Printer
# Harold,46,Supervisor,Management
#
# ============================================================
# âœ… Your Goals:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
# 2. Show the first 5 rows.
# 3. Count how many employees per Position.
# 4. Find the average Age per Position.
# 5. Show only employees with Age > 30.
# 6. Sort employees by Age (youngest â†’ oldest).
# 7. BONUS:
#    - Save only Engineers into "engineers.csv".
#    - Apply .title() to Position and Expertise columns
#      in case they are not formatted properly.
