# üåç Practice Project: Top 10 Most Populous Countries
#
# üìå Scenario
# You are a junior Data Engineer at a logistics company.
# Your manager wants the list of the top 10 most populous countries in the world,
# sorted in descending order by population, extracted directly from Wikipedia.
#
# üéØ Objectives
# - Use Webscraping to extract information from a website.
# - Use Pandas to load and process tabular data as a DataFrame.
# - Use NumPy to manipulate the DataFrame.
# - Export the results to a CSV file.
#
# üîó Data Source
# Wikipedia: List of countries by population (United Nations)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)
#
# üìù Instructions
# 1. Use Pandas to scrape the table from the provided Wikipedia link.
# 2. Identify and select the table containing the population data.
# 3. Clean the data by keeping only the Country and Population columns.
# 4. Convert the population numbers into integers (removing commas if needed).
# 5. Sort the countries by population in descending order.
# 6. Extract the top 10 most populous countries.
# 7. Save the final results to a CSV file named `top10_populous_countries.csv`.
