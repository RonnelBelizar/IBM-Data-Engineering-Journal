# ============================================================
# üìù Exercise: Clean Notes + Count "Python"
# ============================================================

# You are given a text file called "notes.txt" with content like this:
#
# Python is fun
#
# I love learning Python
#
# Data engineering is cool
#
# Python Python everywhere
#
# Your tasks:
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open "notes.txt" in read mode.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clean the text:
#     - Remove blank lines.
#     - Strip spaces at the start and end of each line.
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Write the cleaned lines into a new file called "clean_notes.txt".
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Count how many times the word "Python" appears in the cleaned text.
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Save the count in a new file called "summary.txt" with this format:
#        The word 'Python' appeared X times.
# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Print the content of "summary.txt" to verify.
