# ============================================================
# üìä Exercise: Hospital Appointments Analyzer
# ============================================================
# ‚úÖ Focus: Pandas
#
# üìù Task:
# You are given a CSV file "appointments.csv" with the following format:
#
# Patient,Department,Status,WaitTime
# John,Cardiology,Completed,15
# Alice,Neurology,Cancelled,0
# Mark,Cardiology,Completed,25
# Jane,Dermatology,Completed,10
# Bob,Neurology,Completed,30
#
# ============================================================
# ‚úÖ Your Goals:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Load the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
# 2. Show the first 5 rows.
# 3. Count how many appointments per Department.
# 4. Find the average WaitTime per Department.
# 5. Show only the patients whose appointment was "Completed".
# 6. Sort patients by WaitTime (highest ‚Üí lowest).
# 7. BONUS: Save the "Completed" appointments into a new CSV file.
